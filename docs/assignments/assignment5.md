# Assignment 5: Frontend Design & Implementation

## Heuristic Evaluation

### Usability

#### Error Tolerance

* Likes, dislikes, trusts, and mistrusts can quickly be retracted by clicking a second time on the corresponding button

* Posts and comments will be able to be removed by clicking the "Delete" button next to said item
    * This was not added initially, but follows the heuristic so will be added

### Physical

#### Fitt's Law

* Search bar is very wide and at the top, resulting in a large Fitt's Law score
    * This hightlights the high likelihood of users searching and allows them to select the search bar more easily

* Post creationg area is large and at the side, resulting in a large Fitt's Law score
    * This hightlights the high likelihood of users making a post while use RealTalk

#### Gestalt principles

* Likes and dislikes are right next to each other, as they conceptually fill the same role but in opposite directions
    * This association allows users to see them as clearly connected

* Trusts and mistrusts are right next to each other, as they conceptually fill the same role but in opposite directions
    * This association allows users to see them as clearly connected

* Likes/dislikes and trusts/mistrusts are not near each other, as they conceptually fill completely different roles
    * This reduces the likelihood that users trust every post/comment they like and mistrust every post/comment they dislike, as this is against the philosophy of RealTalk

* Users usernames and profile pictures are right next to each other
    * This makes users associate to two with each other, building a mental view of various online personas

* User stats are near the corresponding username/profile picture
