# About Me

Hi! I'm Jonatan Fontanez, a Master's Computer Science student at MIT. I have a Bachelor's in Science in Computer Science and Engineering from MIT, where I also minored in Mathematics and Philosophy.

I'm interested in theoretical computer science, algorithms, and data structures (most especially graph theory).
